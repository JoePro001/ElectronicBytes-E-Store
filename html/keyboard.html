                        <h3>Quiet and colorful!</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023</p>
                        <p>I've been using this for a week, I got this for work. I work overnights and the backlight
                            brightness can be adjusted for comfort. The mouse clicking is silent, and perfect! The
                            keyboard
                            in comparison is quiet, you can still hear it but its like 90% more quiet than the standard
                            keyboard. Overall an excellent purchase. I have a newborn that's breastfeeding still and now
                            I
                            can continue to work without the clicking of keys distracting the baby while feeding.</p>

                        <h3>Exactly what I was looking for</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2023</p>
                        <p>I always wanted to buy a keyboard and mouse set that lights up, and I finally got one. I'm
                            currently introducing my children to the world of computers, and this colorful illuminated
                            set
                            has added a lot of fun for them. They were excited to figure out how to connect it to the
                            computer on their own. Considering it's a wireless keyboard and mouse set, the price is
                            quite
                            reasonable.</p>
