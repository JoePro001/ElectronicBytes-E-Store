                        <h3>Great phone, OL loves it. Wish I had one!</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2023</p>
                        <p>I got this for my OL who had an 8 year old cell phone something or other cheap-o model. It
                            had
                            gotten so slow that I could almost feel myself getting older waiting for it to do something
                            I
                            wanted from it.f</p>
                        <p>I found this fantastic deal and jumped on it for her. She loves it! I have the previous
                            model,
                            and her phone battery lasts even longer than mine, and I can be out all day long and get
                            home
                            and still have 50%+ battery left, hers beats that by about 10%!</p>
                        <p>Get this phone! The price is fantastic, the delivery is *very* swift, and the phone itself is
                            a
                            marvel to own and use and the free Android and Samsung updates alone for the next 5 years
                            are
                            worth it. Plus, even though it said it would have *slight* blemishes...I was unable to find
                            any!
                            I got a good case and scratch-proof lens and this phone is now even more water resistant
                            than
                            stock and more drop proof. This phone and deal and seller are the way to go!!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="rightreview">
                        <h3>WOOOOOHAAAAA!</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023</p>
                        <p>WOOOHAAAA! This phone leaves the iPhone in the dust... This is by far the best Android
                            phone I ever owned. The price is heavy but once you start using this you'll realize this
                            definitely launches space shuttles in comparison to the older models of yesteryear.</p>
