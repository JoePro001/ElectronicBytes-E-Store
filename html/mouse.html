                        <h3>great little mouse</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023</p>
                        <p>This is a petite mouse, perfect for small hands or travel. It is very comfortable to use and
                            responsive for daily work. As a matter of fact I'm using it right now, well not exactly
                            right
                            now because I'm typing.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, I read a couple of reviews that the USB receiver was missing. I'm not sure that they
                            were looking for it in the right place. The USB receiver is conveniently stored in the
                            battery
                            compartment. This is awesome! Especially when traveling, because it won't fall off and get
                            lost.
                            Lost USB is spoken from experience as that is exactly what happened to the mouse I am
                            replacing.
                            I lost the USB somewhere between home and a visit out of state, yes, somewhere that little
                            USB
                            probably got sucked up into a vacuum cleaner and I was left with a useless hunk of plastic.

                        <h3> Small But Mighty</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023</p>
                        <p>I have had a Logitech mouse for years. I usually get about 2-3 years out of one. Batteries
                            always
                            last a long time. This new one is a little smaller that the others I've had. The wheel is a
                            little loud and stiff but will probably break in fairly quick. There doesn't appear to be
                            any
                            lag in communication with the USB device. Came with battery which was a nice adder. Price
                            was
                            very good. I would buy again.</p>
