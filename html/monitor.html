                        <h3>I never expected this</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2023</p>
                        <p> It comes with a fully adjustable base, a big plus in my case. It is vesa mountable.
                            I am running this 32 inch monitor with an MSI 1070 GPU and it's running it just fine, rarely
                            dropping below frame rates into the 60's it pretty much stays around 100. I thought I was
                            going
                            to have to upgrade my GPU and Motherboard to run this, but decided to hook it up anyway and
                            its
                            working just fine. Doom Eternal runs fine with everything set on high. I never expected
                            that.
                            This model has historically had very volatile pricing.</p>
                        <p>I considered buying the 165hz instead, and had to dig a lot to find out why that pricing is
                            so
                            wonky. I think because the 165hz model is a 1000 R curve and this 144hz model being reviewed
                            is
                            a 1500 R curve. Like many I assume, the 1000 R curve would be a just little to aggressive a
                            curve to fit on my desk top.</p>
                        <p>The first monitor had a fork lift hole right through the front of the monitor. Amazon covered
                            it
                            up with tape and shipped it that way, but made it right in the end and shipped me another.
                            It
                            has been great for over 6 months now, It has played everything I throw at it. It comes with
                            a
                            three year no dead pixel warranty. There are no LED's on the back of either model. The red
                            accents are just stickers that do not light up.</p>

                        <h3>Great monitor and great value</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023</p>
                        <p>Just received this today so I can only relay the first impressions. And those are, it looks
                            great
                            with the curved screen, frameless design (3 sides), great refresh rate, good resolution
                            (QHD), a
                            good set of accessories - i.e. HDMI cable, DP cable, good stand that will allow adjustment
                            of
                            the monitor up and down, left to right, rotate to portrait, etc. Hooked up to a PS5
                            currently
                            and I confirmed 120 Hz in certain games. I have owned AOC monitors since the CRT age and
                            they
                            were always really good and reliable. I hope this will stay true for this one also...</p>
