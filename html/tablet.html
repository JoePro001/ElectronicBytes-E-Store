                        <h3>Premium Quality At A Fantastic Price</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2023</p>
                        <p>I was able to score the is 9th gen iPad on a prime day deal for 250, for under 300 this thing
                            is
                            an absolute beast of a tablet. Sure the design is dated but the accessories to fit this
                            classic
                            design are abundant. Battery life is all day even for someone more gaming centric like
                            myself.
                            Speaking of this thing absolutely games just fine hitting 60 fps on everything I throw at
                            it,
                            along with its 264 ppi display media consumption and social media doom scrolling look
                            fantastic.
                            If you're interested in dabbling in the ecosystem without breaking the bank this is the
                            tablet to try. This budget king is gonna get updates for years to come.</p>

                    <div class="rightreview">
                        <h3>Such a great tablet for a great price!</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023</p>
                        <p>Ive been wanting an tablet for drawing and I saw this gen 9 one on sale and I heard many
                            great
                            things about it. I'm sooo glad I got it, definitely doesn't disappoint. This is a real
                            product btw just make sure you get it from the store on ElectronicBytes and not a
                            refurbished
                            one if that's not what you're looking for. This cost me $249.99 here on ElectronicBytes
                            where as
                            on the store site it's the same product just more pricey it would've been $334. Box came
                            sealed
                            in perfect condition and no scratches or anything wrong with the tablet.</p>
