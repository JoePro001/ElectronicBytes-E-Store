                        <h3> Worth the money, get a full coverage case first.</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023</p>
                        <p>My first intention was not to get the fold, but after going to to best buy, ( physical
                            touching) t- mobile and Samsung store online and doing major research, I decided to get it.
                            Samsung
                            Shop was back ordered until the 29th of July. My new phone itch was kicking in and so looked
                            here
                            and saw they had the cases and they had it! Got the phone days before it was anticipated and
                            I
                            was so geeked out when I got it.</p>
                        <p>I love the large screen inside, the clarity and features are fenominial. I do find the front
                            screen keyboard is much smaller then my previous phone so typing seems odd when
                            texting. So far I have no complaints. Just patiently waiting on the full coverage phone
                            case.
                            Once that is in play then the worry about the accidental scratches will go away. The camera
                            feature is soo much better, opening the fold and not having us to use the fingerprint reader
                            is
                            a plus.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Camera and more memory</h3>

                        <p>Camera could have been better. and also need stylus and additional memory.</p>
