                        <p>For the price, I am not dissatisfied. I'm still playing around
                            with it. Setup was fairly easy and it responded to commands decently.
                            Because it's inexpensive it has very little stabilization assistance
                            aside from auto takeoff, so you will get disoriented with the direction
                            and it will crash, but it survived several crashes admirably (even a
                            20-foot drop to pavement). It worked far better indoors than outdoors.
                            I bought this to see what is on my roof, and now I know what is on the
                            roof--this drone! Just kidding, but it's outdoor flight performance test
                            did dissuaded me from attempting a complete fly-over of our building,
                            which was the reason I bought this drone (to inspect the roof). The provided
                            controller worked at good distance. Controlling via iPhone didn't work
                            beyond 8 feet, which is a shame because you can't trust to fly it using the touch
                            screen and camera visual...you'd lose it or crash it beyond a couple yards.</p>

                        <h3> Overall a nice, FAST little drone!</h3>
                        <p class="date">Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2023</p>
                        <p>Ok, testing this little (fits in the palm of my hand) drone is fun.
                            Though I just got it today and I'll update my review when I've had
                            more time to test it, I want to give a first impression based on what
                            I've seen with it so far. Love the fact that it comes with its own
                            carrying case and extra parts. First off, this little drone is FAST
                            and responsive for its size. Despite its size, it does fight a breeze
                            (just a few mph wind speed) quite well. Turn up the speed to level 3
                            and it seems faster than my Holy Stone HS110D on its own level 5 speed
                            (racing). With respect to its speed, I'm impressed! Secondly, with 2
                            batteries and 2 charge cables you can get back out and enjoy flying quicker.
                            Honestly, the batteries last about 5-7 minutes depending on how many 360°
                            flips and the speed you use. More flips and faster speed lower the amount of
                            flying time per battery. The batteries do charge fairly quickly using the
                            quick charge adapter from my galaxy s10.</p>

                        <p>Now that I've hit on a couple of positive notes, on to some negatives. The primary negative,
                            and
                            it's a major issue, is the fact that the app used to view the pictures/videos is the worst
                            drone
                            app I've ever used. The app crashes constantly and requires an exact order to get it to work
                            (at
                            least for me it did). Even after I got the app to work and was controlling the drone with my
                            phone, the connection was lost while less than 50ft away (the drone was only about 30 ft
                            high)
                            and it flew itself straight into some tree branches and crashed onto concrete, popping 2 of
                            the
                            blade guards off. After putting it back together, I flew it a little longer then changed the
                            battery. This go around I ditched the app and flew it with the controller. Again the drone
                            was
                            only about 30ft high and lost power/connection (the battery wasn't dead as the lights were
                            still
                            on constant) and fell straight down, bounced off the hood of my truck and landed on
                            concrete.
                            Now a positive note about the crashes, the drone held up extremely well with only minor body
                            scratches.
                            All functions I've used so far, 360° flips, trimming, pictures/videos, headless mode, and
                            one
                            touch take off/land have functioned perfectly.
                            All in all, besides the connection glitches with the app and controller, this little drone
                            is
                            impressive and certainly deserves its place among mini drones. I wouldn't be a bit afraid to
                            hand this drone to ANYONE, not just kids, as a gift. It's got the full size drone features
                            adults desire in a kid's sized package and all at a price that's just right!
                            I'll update this review after I've had more time with this drone.
                            Update#1: After flying this drone a few times more, I've found that it can sometimes lose
                            calibration while using headless mode and you'll have to figure out how to get the drone to
                            fly
                            back to you. I set it correctly (with the drone facing directly away from me as per the
                            instructions), and while flying, the drone suddenly started going in different directions
                            than
                            it did when I first turned on headless mode. I got it back to me and recalibrated and
                            decided
                            I'd continue flying without headless mode activated.
                            Speed demon! I must say this again, it's quite a fast and responsive drone for its size
                            especially on the 3rd speed level.
                            Lost connection while flying with the controller and flew into a tree popping a blade guard
                            off.... no real damage besides more body scratches. This thing is nearly indestructible and
                            would be perfect for kids/adults learning to fly (just keep it slow and steady and all will
                            be
                            fine).
                            I still can't get the app on my android phone to stay connected long enough to get a video
                            to
                            post so until the developers correct the issues, no point trying that anymore and
                            unfortunately
                            with no microSD card slot pics and videos aren't going to happen. This also means I can't
                            try
                            the voice control or gestures for camera control.
                            My overall take on this drone: If you're simply looking for a small drone just to fly and
                            possibly fly faster than your buddies larger drones, this would be a great choice. This is a
                            great little learner drone with some connection issues (definitely wouldn't trust flying it
                            over
                            water or anywhere else it could lose connection and be destroyed) and a price that can't be
                            beat
                            for the features you get provided you can get the app to remain connected to the drone.</p>
